# OVERVIEW OF THE CODE
The given code is an implementation of a basic airline reservation system using a linked list data structure in C programming language. It allows the user to reserve a seat, cancel a reservation, display all the reserved seats, and save the details of the reserved seats to a file. The program provides a user interface to select the desired operation by entering a choice number. For each operation, appropriate functions have been defined in the code. The program prompts the user to input their passport number, name, and email address while reserving a seat. The reserved seats are stored in a linked list structure, where each node of the list represents a seat with passport, name, email, and seat number details. The program provides error messages for invalid input and displays a success message for successful seat reservations and cancellations. The airline reservation system can store up to 15 seats. The data of reserved seats can be saved to a file named "airline records" for future reference
